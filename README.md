1. Number Guessing Game (Java Console Application)
Tech Stack: Java (Core Java, Console-based)
Description:
Developed a simple yet engaging number guessing game using Java. The application generates a random number within a predefined range and allows the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts. It provides real-time feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, enhancing user interaction and logic-building skills.
Key Highlights:

Used java.util.Random for random number generation.

Implemented control structures (if-else, while) to manage game flow.

Enhanced user experience with meaningful prompts and result display.

Strengthened logical thinking and input validation skills.

2. Basic Calculator using Switch Case (Java Console Application)
Tech Stack: Java (Core Java, Console-based)
Description:
Built a functional calculator using Java that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation. The calculator takes user input for operands and operation type, then outputs the result based on a switch statement.
Key Highlights:

Implemented a menu-driven interface using switch-case.

Ensured proper input handling and user guidance.

Practiced code modularity and improved understanding of control flow.

Reinforced foundational Java programming skills.
